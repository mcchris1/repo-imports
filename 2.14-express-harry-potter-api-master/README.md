# Harry Potter API

Build an API of hogwarts houses and their members!

## Prerequisites

- Node
- MongoDB and Mongoose
- Express

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Install dependencies.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Complete your work inside of the [`lib/`](lib/) directory. Unless otherwise
specified by an instructor, your submission is due by the time on your cohort
calendar.

## Requirements

This lab is divided into two parts. In the first part, you will set up your
database and seed it with the JSON data provided in the `db/` directory. Once
that is finished, for the second part of this lab, you'll build out an API that
serves the seeded data from your database.

### Part 1: Seeding

We've provided you with two sets of JSON data:
[`houses.json`](./lib/db/houses.json) and
[`characters.json`](./lib/db/characters.json). The `houses` data contains a
`member` property that is an array of ObjectIDs matching objects in the
`characters` data (the `_id` property).

Define a model to represent the houses inside of `houses.json` with a
subdocument model to represent the characters in `characters.json`.

Once your models are defined, write a seed file that takes the data in
`houses.json` and `characters.json` and seeds it into the database.

### Part 2: API

Your database is now all set up, so it's time to build an API around it. Your
API will need the following routes:

1. A root route (`'/'`) that redirects to the houses route.
1. A houses list route (`'/house'`) that returns a JSON array of all the houses
   in the database.
1. A house detail route (`'/house/5a05e2b252f721a3cf2ea33f'`) that returns the
   document for the house in the url parameter.
1. A house create route (`'/house'`) that a user could send a `POST` request to
   in order to create a new house.

## Bonus

### Query Strings

Implement [query strings](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.query). This
would allow someone to look up a house in the database by any property of the
document. For example:

- `/house?mascot=lion`
- `/house?houseGhost=The Grey Lady`
- `/house?headOfHouse=Severus Snape`

### `ref`

Rather than nesting the `Character` model in `House` as a subdocument, use the
model to create a `character` collection and `house` collection. Seed the data
into the two collections and then relate the two with a `ref`. That would mean
that your `members` property of a house would be an array of ObjectIDs from the
characters collection.

Check out [the documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html) on how
to do this.
